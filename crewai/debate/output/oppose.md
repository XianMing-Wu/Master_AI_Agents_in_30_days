Love does not exist in the world as an objective, tangible force—it is not a thing, but a story we tell ourselves to explain complex chemical reactions and social conditioning. What proponents call "love" is merely the brain’s release of dopamine, oxytocin, and serotonin, evolutionary mechanisms designed to promote bonding and reproduction, not evidence of some transcendent emotion. The so-called "acts of compassion" cited—parental sacrifice, heroism, caregiving—are better explained by instinct, duty, societal expectation, or even self-interest, not an invisible, intangible "love." If love truly existed as a universal force, why is it so inconsistently distributed? Why do marriages fail, children suffer neglect, and wars rage with hatred? The world operates on power, survival, and transactional relationships—not love. Furthermore, if love were real and observable, it could be measured in a lab like gravity or electricity; instead, it only “exists” through subjective interpretation, poetic language, and cultural myth-making. Art and literature don’t prove love’s existence any more than dragons are proven by medieval tapestries. Science explains the mechanisms behind attachment, but that doesn’t elevate a biochemical process into something mystical or universally real. To claim love exists is to confuse narrative with reality. The truth is: love is a comforting illusion, a label we slap onto fleeting feelings and social obligations to make sense of chaos. It does not govern human behavior—fear, desire, and necessity do. Therefore, when stripped of romanticism, the motion collapses: love, as commonly understood, does not exist in the world.
